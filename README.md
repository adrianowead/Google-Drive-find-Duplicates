# Google-Drive-find-Duplicates
A quick and dirty, not yet done Python 3 script to find duplicates.

I thought I might not have that many and that I could just delete the duplicates, but alas, there are many duplicates and I don't have the time to clean it up.

I just bought another 100GB storage....

The script does not delete any files. It just checks for duplicated. Comments are scarce as I did not intend to commit it. Feel free to use it.

Also, there is not reference to file deletions in Google Drive API v3, only in V2. The code for V2 is in here (uncommented). Test it out if you wish.
